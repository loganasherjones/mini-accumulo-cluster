# Mini Accumulo Cluster Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the unofficial Mini Accumulo Cluster.
Accumulo comes with a builtin Mini Accumulo Cluster, but it is hard
to configure, doesn't work with later versions of Java, and does not
provide a container based solution.

This project sets out to solve all of these problems and provide a
better experience for integration testing of an Accumulo Cluster.
